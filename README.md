# Python Basics - Final Task Submission

## Objective
This repository contains Python scripts covering fundamental concepts, including:

1. **modular_functions.py** - Demonstrates how to use functions to calculate areas of different shapes.
2. **control_structures.py** - Explores conditional statements, loops, and lists.
3. **datatypes.py** - Showcases different data types in Python and type conversions.

## How to Run the Scripts
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. To run any script:

```bash
python scripts/modular_functions.py
python scripts/control_structures.py
python scripts/datatypes.py


What I Learned
How to structure a Python project with multiple scripts.
The importance of functions for reusability and modularity.
Working with different control structures and data types.
How to use GitHub for version control and project submission.
